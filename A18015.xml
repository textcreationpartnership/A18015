            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no man liuing vnder the Sun, which feeleth not the painfull effect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, in the bitter ſence of wofull miſeries. But the godly and beſt diſpoſed perſons, in whatſoeuer time, place, or calling they liue, are conſtrained with <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cirene</hi> to beare the Croſſe after their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Chriſt. For why, there be not only miniſtred vnto them many mightie cauſes of <hi>Diſcontentation,</hi> through thoſe greeuous oppreſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vrged on them by the vngodly, whom the Lord maketh his roddes to correct and puniſh his owne when they offende him: wherby the very heart of <hi>Mary</hi> is pearced with the ſword, as <hi>Simeon</hi> propheſied: but alſo the holie ſpirit in them is moued, through the horrible ſinnes and greeuous offences of the ingratefull againſt God, to driue the meſtiue mill of lamentation, with flouds of weeping teares. All rhe which (neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) the Lord of mercie, and God of conſolation, mittigateth and moderateth in them that feare and loue him, both by the inward comforts of his ſpirit, and by the externall miniſterie of his word. But as for the vngodly (which are meere ſtraungers from the wombe, and naturally deuoyd of peace, like the raging waues of the ſea that caſt out their own filth) the Lord ſuffreth Satan to rule them at his pleaſure: he giueth them ouer, to be deſtroyed in their owne luſts, as ſuch of whom he hath no regard, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them to ſpeake lyes, to prophane his holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and to ſway in their abhominable ſinnes, vntil
<pb facs="tcp:7974:8"/>
their wickedneſſe be full, when he is willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them with his iuſt iudgements in diſpleaſure. In the meane time, waxing proud, and climbing on high through hautie preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Lords long ſuffring (which ſhould rather drawe ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance) they take no meane pleaſure and glory to oppreſſe and offend the Lords little ones, and daily deuiſe and endeuour to diſturbe &amp; trouble the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable tranquilitie and peace of the Chriſtian Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale: wheras placing the Lord Ieſus on the high Pinacle of the Temple, they aſſaie how they might caſt him downe headlong, to the great griefe of the godly thereby offended, the diſhonour of Chriſt, therby contemned: and the prouocation of the God of heauen, thereby diſpleaſed and vrged to powre downe his terrible vengeance and vnhappie woe vppon them by whome thoſe offences come. The ſtate &amp; condition not only of other times and nations, but alſo of this our owne, yeeld vs too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pittifull examples of this Argument. Wherein, we ſee how the rough raging waues of humane de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſes, ſuggeſted and prouoked by the high bluſtring winds of diuelliſh Ambition, haue not a litle mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and perplexed (I ſay not thoſe Marriners that embarqued <hi>Ionas</hi> towardes <hi>Tharſus</hi> only, but alſo) <hi>Noah</hi> and his familie in the Arke: the Apoſtles of Chriſt in the ſhip, and ſuch as are paſſengers euen in the ſame veſſell with Chriſt towardes the Hauen of happineſſe. Beſides that, we may ſee, how that on the very maine land, litle <hi>Dauid</hi> hath very much ado to reſcue the ſeely ſheepe from the hungrie Lyons teeth. An houſe is much ſooner throwne downe, then reedified: a Citie is not ſo eaſily reduced into
<pb facs="tcp:7974:8"/>
vnitie and concorde, as it is diuided. And ſurely there, where the diſtracted mindes and wandering opinions of ambitious heads, haue not only contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and commenced, but alſo drawne foorth and twiſted the odious threede of <hi>Diſcontentation,</hi> wee may expect none other thing therof, but vtter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertions of Townes, Cities, Countries, Churches, Kingdomes, without ſpeedie preuention. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this is that, which in the account of all wiſe men is vnhappie, and after the iudgement of all the godly, moſt vngodly, and the occaſion of greater courage and boldneſſe to the forraign enemy, then the feebleſt reſiſtances of them that be combined in true concord and peace.</p>
            <p>But what is that to vs? I would (indeede) that theſe things did neither touch vs, nor were found rowſting in our houſes! but, when the vizard of hautie conceit and proper integritie, is remooued from our bleared eyes, we cannot but plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the Church (notwithſtanding the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere preaching of the word of God in the ſame) is intollerably burthened with Sectes opinions, and dangerous Sciſmes: and that the whole Common-wealth is no leſſe vnhappily peſtred with diſcords, diſſentions, ſeditions, and many other huge enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and euilles of this laſt age and wane of the worlde, wherein the bande of Chriſtian Charitie is broken, he Truth (though ſo ſtrong and aboue all) is entertained but as a wandering Pilgrime on the earth, euen with them that fawne on her preſence: the right faith is ſorely co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned by them that haue taken vp weapons vnder pretence to defende her: and the Prince of darkneſſe groweth ſtronger and
<pb facs="tcp:7974:9"/>
ſtronger without reſiſtance, towards the end of his raigne in the world, who hath vehemently enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſtrongly prouoked the enemies of the Church againſt the Church: to the which they threaten fire and ſword, and daily endeuor deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And this to compaſſe &amp; effect, they haue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hands with mightie Potentates, they haue ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wel waged ſouldiers, they haue prepared their ſtrong barbed Horſes, their ſwift Chariots, and a thouſand warlike engins, to the terror of the weake in ſpirit, to the affliction of poore <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and to the diſhonor of the name of God: who laugheth them to ſcorne, and knoweth wel how to confound them in their owne deuiſes, when it ſhall pleaſe him to expreſſe his diſpleaſure towards them, and his loue to his children. But what inconueniences may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the preſent miſchiefes, who knoweth not, that hath wiſedome to diſcerne thereof? and what good Chriſtian would not endeuour to ſtop and preuent the ſame? Therfore (though after many others, yet with and among ſome others) to meete with thoſe deſperate maladies, and to aſſay to preuent whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer greater euils may thereof enſue (according to that meane wiſedome and abilitie the Lord hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me) I haue confected <hi>A Preparatiue to Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation:</hi> and made the ſame Applicatory to this our time, Nation, and the preſent occaſion. An Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt neceſſary to be vrged, and a thing in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt expectation of all good mindes, within whom the holy ſpirit of diſcipline is made ſad and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, through the conſiderarion of the manifold diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders and huge inconueniences of noyſome <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentation,</hi> and to whoſe good natures, the true
<pb facs="tcp:7974:9"/>
               <hi>Contentation,</hi> is euery way both profitable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, in the feare of God, and honour of the Prince, (howſoeuer harriſh and vnpleaſant it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the taſte of him that is oppreſſed with the humor of ſingular conceit) as thoſe potions which are in taſte bitter and ſowre, may be more wholſom for the diſtreſſed patient, then ſuch as are ſweet and wallowiſh. And (indeed) although I could not be ſo briefe as <hi>Phocian</hi> was in the Citie of <hi>Athenes:</hi> nor (if I could) would I be either ſo copious as <hi>Demoſthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> with the <hi>Graecians,</hi> or ſo eloquent as <hi>Cicero</hi> with the <hi>Romains,</hi> to whoſe learned immitatours I referre both the lapping vp of plaine things in obſcuritie, and the handling of publique controuerſies in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple diſcourſes: yet haue I wiſhed and indeuoured to be rather modeſt with <hi>Paule,</hi> and charitable with <hi>Iohn,</hi> then impudent with <hi>Tartullus,</hi> and curious with <hi>Peter</hi>: hazarding al my credit &amp; eaſe, in regard of your profit and peace. Moreouer, albeit I know wel, that to many of you, this my preſent <hi>Preparatiue</hi> ſhalbe but like the glimmering light of a Candle ſet in the bright Sun ſhining, hauing (indeed) litle need of this meane helpe: yet I perſwade, that ye which loue brotherly fellowſhip, feare God, and honour the Prince, will not diſdaine it, but rather, that ye will be the more readie vpon this, and ſuch like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, to ſtand vp in the defence of the truth againſt all erronious opinions, vaine deuiſes, and ſyniſter practiſes of man, as it beſt becommeth you with all ſuch as be of the houſhold of faith.

I forbid not any man (I ſay) to remember God, but I forbid him to reaſon of God: neither diſlike I that a man ſhuld reaſon ſo far as that godlineſſe be not neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: but I like not that, which is done out of ſeaſon:

But what did the Tyraunt <hi>Dionyſe</hi>? Hee robbed and ſpoyled the Temple of <hi>Iupiter Olympius,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dionyſe rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iupiter. <hi>Cicero de Nat. deo. lib.</hi> 3.</note> when hee thirſted after the Treaſures of the ſame, and defended his ſacriledge therein by a fayre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and ſhewe of honeſtie.

This practiſe hath he taught to many of thoſe title Chriſtians, ſo well contented to imitate him therin, who euer diſdaining the ſtate of the church, and of the miniſters of the word, and enuying the bleſsings that by the great zeale, regard and benefite of good princes, it hath pleaſed God to exhibite vnto them, &amp; thinking that the litle cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber which the noble <hi>Sunemite</hi> prepared for <hi>Eliſha</hi> the man of God, is too large for him,<note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 4.10.</note> and the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof too magnificent: they ſtirre moſt eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diminiſh this portion, to pull down the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber walles.
